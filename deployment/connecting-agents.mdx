## Overview

MCP servers use a standard protocol — any MCP-compatible client can connect to your generated server. This includes AI assistants, IDEs with AI features, agent frameworks, and custom applications.

## Connection methods

Generated servers support three transports:

| Transport | Use case | Connection |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **stdio** | Local clients that launch the server as a subprocess | Command + args |
| **SSE** | Network-based clients connecting over HTTP | URL endpoint |
| **Streamable HTTP** | Newer HTTP-based MCP transport | URL endpoint |

Most MCP clients default to **stdio** — the client starts your server process and communicates via stdin/stdout.

## stdio connection (most common)

The client launches your server as a subprocess. No network setup needed.

### Configuration file

Most MCP clients use a JSON configuration file (commonly `.mcp.json`, `mcp.json`, or a client-specific config file). The structure is standardized:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-api": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Your generated server includes a pre-configured `.mcp.json` file — copy its contents into your client's MCP configuration.

<Warning>
  Always use **absolute paths** to `server.py`. Most MCP clients do not resolve relative paths.
</Warning>

### Using a virtual environment

If you installed dependencies in a virtual environment, point to the Python binary inside it:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-api": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/my-api-server/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/my-api-server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Where clients look for config

Different clients read MCP configuration from different locations. Check your client's documentation for the exact path. Common patterns:

- **Project-level**: `.mcp.json` or `mcp.json` in the project root
- **Global/user-level**: A config file in the client's settings directory (e.g., `~/.config/<client>/`)
- **Client settings UI**: Some clients let you add MCP servers through a settings panel

## Network connection (SSE / HTTP)

For remote or containerized servers, start with a network transport:

```bash
# SSE transport
python server.py --transport sse --port 8000

# Streamable HTTP transport
python server.py --transport streamable-http --port 8000
```

Then configure your client with the URL:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-api": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

This is the standard approach for Docker deployments, remote servers, and shared environments.

## Multiple servers

You can connect multiple MCP servers to a single client. Each server runs independently:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/gmail-server/server.py"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/github-server/server.py"]
    },
    "stripe": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/stripe-server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

The AI agent sees all tools from all servers and selects the right one based on context.

## Verifying the connection

After configuring your client:

1. Restart the client (most clients read config on startup)
2. Check that your API's tools are listed in the client's tool/MCP panel
3. Ask the agent to perform an operation: *"List all users using the my-api server"*

If tools don't appear, run `python server.py` directly in a terminal to verify the server starts without errors.

## Troubleshooting

### Server doesn't appear in the client

- Verify the path to `server.py` is absolute and correct
- Ensure `python` resolves to Python 3.11+ (try `python3` if needed)
- Check that `requirements.txt` dependencies are installed
- Restart the client completely after changing config

### Tools appear but return errors

- Check your `.env` file has correct credentials
- Run `python server.py` in a terminal to see detailed error output
- Verify the target API is reachable from your machine

### OAuth2 authorization prompt

For APIs using OAuth2, the first connection may open a browser for authorization. Run `python server.py` once in a terminal to complete the OAuth flow. After that, tokens are cached and the server works non-interactively.
