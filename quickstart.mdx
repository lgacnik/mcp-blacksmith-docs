## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** installed on your machine
- An **OpenAPI specification** for the API you want to wrap (JSON or YAML)

Don't have a specification handy? Try one of these:

- **[The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com)** ([specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thatapicompany/apis/main/theCatAPI.com/thecatapi-oas.yaml)) — Cat images, breeds, and facts. 18 endpoints, some public, some require a free API key
- **[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)** ([specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastienlevert/jsonplaceholder-api/main/openapi.yaml)) — Fake REST API for testing. 5 endpoints, fully public, no authentication required

<Tip>
  Looking for more APIs? The [APIs.guru OpenAPI Directory](https://apis.guru) maintains thousands of validated OpenAPI specifications from real-world APIs.

## Step 1: Generate your server

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the dashboard">
    Go to [mcpblacksmith.com/dashboard](https://mcpblacksmith.com/dashboard) and create a new project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload your specification">
    Drag and drop your OpenAPI specification file (JSON or YAML) into the upload zone. Blacksmith supports OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger), 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    Optionally enable *Pass 0: Metadata Filter* to remove read-only and server-generated fields, or *Pass 1–5* (paid) to optimize tool descriptions, examples, and constraints for AI consumption. See [Enhancement Passes](/generation/enhancement-passes) for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate">
    Click **Generate**. Blacksmith analyzes your specification, extracts all operations, builds typed models, configures authentication, and generates the complete server code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download">
    Download the generated server as a ZIP file. Extract it to a directory of your choice.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
cd my-api-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 3: Configure credentials

If your API requires authentication, open the `.env` file and fill in your credentials:

```bash .env
# Example: API Key authentication
API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Example: Bearer token
BEARER_TOKEN=your-token-here

# Example: OAuth2
OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

The `.env` file is pre-configured with the correct variable names for your API's authentication scheme. You only need to configure the credentials for the tools you intend to use. If a tool requires credentials that are not provided, a warning is logged and the request will likely be rejected by the upstream API — unless the endpoint is public and does not require authentication.

See [Authentication](/server/authentication) for details on each authentication type.

## Step 4: Run the server

```bash
python server.py
```

By default, the server starts with `stdio` transport — the standard for local MCP connections. You'll see output like:

```
INFO: MCP server 'The Cat API' started (transport: stdio)
```

## Step 5: Connect to an MCP client

Add your server to your MCP client's configuration. Most clients use a JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-cat-api": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your MCP client so the new configuration is picked up. Your API tools are now available to the AI agent.
