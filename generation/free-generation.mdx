## Always free

Base server generation is **free with no limits**. Generate as many servers as you want, from any OpenAPI specification, with full source code ownership.

## What's included

Every generated server includes:

- **Complete MCP server** with tool definitions for every API operation
- **Typed Pydantic models** for request parameter validation
- **Format validators** for 25+ JSON Schema formats (dates, emails, UUIDs, etc.)
- **Auto-configured authentication** based on your specification's security schemes
- **Resilience features** — retries, circuit breaker, rate limiting, multi-layer timeouts
- **Optional response validation** against the API's response schema
- **Docker support** with production-ready Dockerfile
- **MCP client config template** (`.mcp.json`)
- **README** with setup and usage instructions

## What's not included (optional AI passes)

The base generator works directly from your OpenAPI specification without AI processing. For additional optimization, see [AI-Enhanced Passes](/generation/ai-passes):

- Parameter curation (removing server-generated fields)
- LLM-friendly description optimization
- Token-efficient schema rewriting

These are optional, credit-based enhancements for production use.
