description: "Validate your OpenAPI specification before generation to catch issues early."

## Overview

MCP Blacksmith can validate your OpenAPI specification for structural issues, missing definitions, and common problems before generating a server. Validation is optional but recommended for specifications you haven't tested before.

## What's checked

- **Schema validity** — Correct OpenAPI structure per the specification version
- **Reference resolution** — All `$ref` references point to existing definitions
- **Required fields** — Operations have the required metadata (paths, methods, responses)
- **Type consistency** — Parameter types match their declared schemas
- **Security scheme definitions** — Referenced security schemes exist in `securitySchemes`

## How to use

In the [dashboard](https://mcpblacksmith.com/dashboard):

1. Upload your specification
2. Open the **Validation** tab
3. Click **Validate** to run the analysis
4. Review any issues — each includes the location in your specification and a suggested fix

## Validation results

Issues are categorized by severity:

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Error** | Will likely cause generation failures or broken tools |
| **Warning** | Generation will work, but results may be suboptimal |
| **Info** | Suggestions for improving specification quality |

Fix errors before generating. Warnings and informational items are advisory.
