## Overview

After generation, MCP Blacksmith can lint the generated code to verify correctness. This checks for syntax errors, import issues, type problems, and code quality.

## Available checkers

| Checker | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **AST** | Parses all Python files to verify valid syntax |
| **Ruff** | Fast Python linter — catches style issues, unused imports, undefined names |
| **Import** | Verifies all imports resolve correctly |
| **Pyright** | Static type checking for type safety |
| **Pydantic** | Validates Pydantic model definitions |

## How to use

In the [dashboard](https://mcpblacksmith.com/dashboard):

1. Generate your server
2. Open the **Linting** tab
3. Select which checkers to run
4. Review results in the Problems panel

## Interpreting results

Linting results appear in the Problems panel, grouped by file and severity. Each issue includes the file, line number, and a description of the problem.

<Note>
  Generated code is designed to pass all linting checks. If you see lint errors on freshly generated code, please [report it](https://mcpblacksmith.com/contact) — it helps us improve the generator.
