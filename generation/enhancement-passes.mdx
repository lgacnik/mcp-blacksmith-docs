description: "Optional optimization passes that improve your generated server for production use."

## Overview

Enhancement passes analyze your API operations and optimize the generated server for better AI agent interaction. Passes make tools and parameters not only LLM-friendly but also token-aware — reducing the number of tokens consumed by tool definitions while preserving their semantic meaning.

Pass 0 is rule-based and free. Passes 1–5 are AI-driven and consume credits.

## Available passes

### Pass 0: Metadata Filter

Removes read-only and computed fields, plus deprecated operations, based on OpenAPI metadata. This pass does not use AI and is always free.

- Filter parameters — removes read-only and server-generated fields
- Filter operations — removes deprecated operations

### Pass 1: Field Curator

Filters low-value parameters like pagination controls, debug flags, and redundant fields for cleaner tool interfaces.

### Pass 2: Operation Classifier

Distinguishes core CRUD operations from utility endpoints like health checks and metadata, focusing tools on valuable actions.

### Pass 3: Parameter Scorer

Scores each parameter's importance (0–10) based on functional value and likely usage, filtering those below a configurable threshold.

### Pass 4: Parameter Transformer

Converts complex parameters into user-friendly inputs (email bodies, timestamps, file uploads) with automatic helper functions.

### Pass 5: Tool Enhancer

Improves tool names and descriptions for better discoverability, making operations and parameters more intuitive for AI agents to use.

## How to use

In the [dashboard](https://mcpblacksmith.com/dashboard):

1. Upload your specification and generate the base server (free)
2. In the Generation tab, enable the passes you want
3. Configure which operations to optimize (all or selected)
4. Click Generate — credits are consumed based on operation count for Passes 1–5

## Credits

Passes 1–5 consume credits based on the number of operations and parameters processed. Pass 0 is always free. See [Pricing](https://mcpblacksmith.com/pricing) for details.

Base generation is free and requires no credits. All passes are entirely optional.
