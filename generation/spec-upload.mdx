## Supported formats

MCP Blacksmith accepts OpenAPI specifications in:

| Format | Versions | File types |
|--------|----------|------------|
| OpenAPI | 2.0 (Swagger), 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 3.2.x | `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml` |

Have a Postman Collection or Google Discovery document instead? You can convert them to OpenAPI using [postman-to-openapi](https://joolfe.github.io/postman-to-openapi/) or [google-discovery-to-openapi](https://github.com/stackql/google-discovery-to-openapi), then upload the result.

<Note>
  Support for additional API specification formats is planned, including GraphQL, gRPC (Protocol Buffers), AsyncAPI, RAML, and API Blueprint.

## How to upload

In the [dashboard](https://mcpblacksmith.com/dashboard):

1. Create a new project
2. Drag and drop your specification file into the upload zone, or click to browse
3. Blacksmith parses and validates the specification immediately

## Where to find specifications

Most APIs publish their OpenAPI specification. Common locations:

- **API documentation pages** — Look for "OpenAPI", "Swagger", or "API Reference" links
- **Common URL patterns** — `/openapi.json`, `/swagger.json`, `/api-docs`, `/v3/api-docs`
- **GitHub repositories** — Many companies publish specifications in their public repos
- **Public registries** — [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/search) or [APIs.guru](https://apis.guru)

## Specification quality tips

While any valid specification should result in a fully functional server, better specifications produce better servers:

- **Include descriptions** — These become tool descriptions for AI agents
- **Define security schemes** — Authentication handlers are auto-generated
- **Use component schemas** — Shared references produce deduplicated models
- **Specify response schemas** — Enables response validation at runtime
