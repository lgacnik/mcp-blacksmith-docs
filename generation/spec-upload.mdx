## Supported formats

MCP Blacksmith accepts OpenAPI specifications in:

| Format | Versions | File types |
|--------|----------|------------|
| OpenAPI | 2.0 (Swagger), 3.0.x, 3.1.x, 3.2.x | `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml` |

Swagger 2.0 specs are automatically converted to OpenAPI 3.x internally before generation.

## How to upload

In the [dashboard](https://mcpblacksmith.com/dashboard):

1. Create a new project
2. Drag and drop your spec file into the upload zone, or click to browse
3. Blacksmith parses and validates the spec immediately

## Where to find specs

Most APIs publish their OpenAPI specification. Common locations:

- **API documentation pages** — Look for "OpenAPI", "Swagger", or "API Reference" links
- **Common URL patterns** — `/openapi.json`, `/swagger.json`, `/api-docs`, `/v3/api-docs`
- **GitHub repositories** — Many companies publish specs in their public repos
- **SwaggerHub** — Public registry at [swaggerhub.com](https://app.swaggerhub.com/search)

## Spec quality tips

Better specs produce better servers:

- **Include descriptions** on operations and parameters — these become tool descriptions for AI agents
- **Define security schemes** — Blacksmith generates auth handlers from `securitySchemes`
- **Use component schemas** — Shared schemas (`$ref`) produce cleaner, deduplicated models
- **Specify response schemas** — Enables response validation in the generated server
