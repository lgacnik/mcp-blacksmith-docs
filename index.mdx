## What is MCP Blacksmith?

MCP Blacksmith transforms API specifications into fully functional [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers. Upload an OpenAPI spec, and get complete Python code — with authentication, security, validation, and resilience — ready to deploy anywhere.

**You own every line of generated code.** Download it, modify it, deploy it, sell it. No attribution, no royalties, no lock-in.

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol** is an open standard that lets AI agents interact with external services through a unified interface. Instead of building custom integrations for every API, an AI agent connects to MCP servers that handle the complexity of authentication, request formatting, and error handling.

One AI client connects to multiple MCP servers — each wrapping a different API:

```
AI Agent (Claude, GPT, etc.)
  ├── MCP Server: Gmail API
  ├── MCP Server: Stripe API
  ├── MCP Server: GitHub API
  └── MCP Server: Your Internal API
```

Each MCP server exposes API operations as **tools** that the AI agent can call. The server handles authentication, rate limiting, retries, and validation transparently.

## Who is Blacksmith for?

- **Developers** who need MCP servers for their APIs without weeks of manual coding
- **Teams** integrating multiple APIs into AI agent workflows
- **Companies** wanting to expose their APIs to AI agents securely
- **Anyone** building with Claude, GPT, Cursor, or other MCP-compatible AI tools
