## What is MCP Blacksmith?

MCP Blacksmith transforms API specifications into fully functional [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers. Upload an OpenAPI specification, and get complete Python code — with authentication, security, and validation — ready to deploy anywhere.

**You own every line of generated code.** Download it, modify it, deploy it, sell it. No attribution, no royalties, no lock-in.

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard for connecting AI applications to external systems. It provides a standardized way for AI agents and applications to access data sources, tools, and workflows — without building custom integrations for every API.

MCP Blacksmith generates these MCP servers from OpenAPI specifications. Each generated server wraps an API and exposes its operations as **tools** that any MCP-compatible AI client can call:

```
AI Agent
  ├── MCP Server: Gmail API
  ├── MCP Server: Stripe API
  ├── MCP Server: GitHub API
  └── MCP Server: Your Internal API
```

The server handles authentication, request formatting, error handling, and validation transparently — the AI agent sees simple tools with typed parameters and gets clean responses.

## Who is Blacksmith for?

- **Developers** who need MCP servers for their APIs without weeks of manual coding
- **Teams** integrating multiple APIs into AI agent workflows
- **Companies** wanting to expose their APIs to AI agents securely
- **Anyone** building with MCP-compatible AI tools and IDEs

You don't need deep technical expertise to generate MCP servers. All you need is an OpenAPI specification for the API your agent needs access to.
