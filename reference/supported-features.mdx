## Specification versions

| Version | Support |
|---------|---------|
| OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger) | Full support |
| OpenAPI 3.0.x | Full support |
| OpenAPI 3.1.x | Full support |
| OpenAPI 3.2.x | Full support |

## Operations

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE | Full |
| HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE | Extracted but rarely useful as MCP tools |
| Parameters (path, query, header, cookie) | Full — all locations supported |
| Request body (JSON) | Full |
| Request body (form-data) | Full |
| Request body (multipart) | Partial — file uploads are type-mapped |
| Multiple content types | First JSON type preferred |

## Schemas

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| `$ref` references | Full — including nested, circular, and deep chains |
| `$defs` (JSON Schema 2020-12) | Full — hoisted to components for standard resolution |
| `allOf` composition | Full — property merging across multiple schemas |
| `oneOf` / `anyOf` | Mapped to union types with `discriminator` support for Pydantic discriminated unions |
| `const` | Full — mapped to `Literal[value]` (OAS 3.1) |
| `enum` | Full — mapped to `Literal` types |
| `nullable` | Full — mapped to `X \| None` |
| Type arrays (OAS 3.1) | Full — `"type": ["string", "null"]` mapped to union types |
| Nested objects | Full — generates nested Pydantic models |
| Arrays | Full — mapped to `list[T]` |
| Dictionaries | Full — mapped to `dict[str, T]` |
| `additionalProperties` | Schema value mapped to `dict[str, ValueType]`; `true`/`false` mapped to `dict[str, Any]` |
| Circular / recursive schemas | Full — detected and resolved with forward-reference class names |
| Numeric constraints | `minimum`, `maximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`, `multipleOf` mapped to Pydantic field constraints |
| String constraints | `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern` mapped to Pydantic constraints. Regex patterns validated for engine compatibility |
| Array constraints | `minItems`, `maxItems` mapped to length constraints on lists |
| `format` validators | 30+ formats — date/time, identifiers, network, URI, numeric, binary, regex, phone (see [Security Features](/server/security)) |
| `default` values | Full |
| `example` / `examples` | Full — preserved in Pydantic `Field` metadata |
| `deprecated` | Tracked on fields and operations, preserved in metadata |
| `readOnly` / `writeOnly` | Respected in request vs. response models |

## Authentication

| Scheme | Support |
|--------|---------|
| API Key (header, query, cookie) | Full |
| HTTP Bearer | Full |
| HTTP Basic | Full |
| OAuth 2.0 (all flows) | Full |
| OpenID Connect | Full |
| Mutual TLS | Full |

## Not supported

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Callbacks / Webhooks | MCP servers are request-driven, not event-driven |
| Links | Informational only, not actionable in MCP context |
| XML request/response bodies | JSON only |
| `oneOf` discriminator tag mapping | `oneOf` unions are supported, but the optional `discriminator.mapping` feature (aliasing variant tags to schema references) is not. Standard `oneOf` with or without a `propertyName` discriminator works normally |
| Multi-file specifications | Specifications must be a single file. Multi-file bundles (split across `$ref`-linked files) are not yet accepted — bundle them into one file before uploading |
