## Product

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is MCP?">
    The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI agents to interact with external services. It provides a unified way for AI systems to securely discover and call tools exposed by MCP servers. Learn more at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is MCP Blacksmith?">
    MCP Blacksmith generates production-ready MCP servers from OpenAPI specifications. Upload a specification, and get complete Python code with authentication, security, and validation — ready to deploy anywhere. See [About](https://mcpblacksmith.com/about) for more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What API specifications are supported?">
    OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger), 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 in JSON or YAML format. Most modern APIs provide OpenAPI specifications, and many legacy APIs can be documented in this format. See [Specification Upload](/generation/spec-upload) for conversion tools and where to find specifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the generated code commercially?">
    Yes. You own all generated code outright. Use it for personal projects, commercial products, client work — no attribution required, no royalties, no restrictions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I host the generated servers?">
    Anywhere you can run Python 3.11+. Self-host on your infrastructure, deploy to any cloud, run in Docker, or use <a href="https://mcparmory.com" target="_blank" style={{color: 'hsl(199, 100%, 57%)'}}>MCP Armory</a> for managed hosting. See [Self-Hosting](/deployment/self-hosting) for deployment options.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What programming language is generated?">
    Python, using the [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) framework and [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev) for validation. TypeScript generation is on the roadmap.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which MCP clients are supported?">
    Any MCP-compatible client — AI assistants, IDEs with AI features, agent frameworks, and custom applications. Generated servers support stdio, SSE, and streamable-http transports. See [Connecting to AI Agents](/deployment/connecting-agents) for setup instructions.
  </Accordion>

## Pricing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is server generation free?">
    Yes. Base server generation and Pass 0 (Metadata Filter) are free — no credits required. You only pay for AI-driven passes 1–5 (parameter curation, description optimization). See [Pricing](https://mcpblacksmith.com/pricing) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do credits work?">
    Credits are consumed only when using AI-driven passes (1–5). Credit usage depends on the number of operations and parameters being optimized. Pass 0 is always free. No subscriptions — buy credits when you need them, use them at your own pace. Credits are valid for 1 year. See [Pricing](https://mcpblacksmith.com/pricing) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do enhancement passes do?">
    Enhancement passes optimize your generated server for AI agent interaction. Pass 0 (free) removes read-only fields and deprecated operations based on metadata. Passes 1–5 (AI-driven) curate parameters, score importance, improve descriptions, and rewrite schemas to be token-efficient. See [Enhancement Passes](/generation/enhancement-passes) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out of credits?">
    Free generation and Pass 0 always work. Only AI-driven passes (1–5) are blocked when you have insufficient credits. Your existing generated servers remain fully accessible.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What authentication types are supported?">
    API Key, Bearer Token, HTTP Basic, OAuth 2.0 (all flows), OpenID Connect, JWT, and Mutual TLS. Authentication is auto-configured from your OpenAPI specification's security schemes. See [Authentication](/server/authentication) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What security features are included?">
    Every generated server includes bidirectional input/output validation, circuit breakers, exponential backoff with retries, rate limiting, and multi-layer timeouts — protecting both the AI agent and the target API. See [Security](/server/security) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I modify the generated code?">
    Yes. It's standard Python — edit anything you want. See [Customizing Your Server](/server/customizing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What Python version is required?">
    Python 3.11 or higher.
