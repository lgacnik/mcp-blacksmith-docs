  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I host the generated servers?">
    Anywhere you can run Python 3.11+. Self-host on your infrastructure, deploy to any cloud, run in Docker, or use <a href="https://mcparmory.com" target="_blank" style={{color: 'hsl(199, 100%, 57%)'}}>MCP Armory</a> for managed hosting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What programming language is generated?">

## Pricing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is server generation free?">
    Yes. Base server generation is free with no limits. Generate as many servers as you want. You only pay for optional AI-enhanced passes (parameter curation, description optimization).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do credits work?">
    Credits are consumed only when using AI-enhanced features. Credit usage depends on the number of operations and parameters being optimized. See [Pricing](https://mcpblacksmith.com/pricing) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out of credits?">
    Free generation always works. Only AI-enhanced passes are blocked when you have insufficient credits. Your existing generated servers remain fully accessible.
